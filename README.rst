A robust workflow for applying deep learning on imaging- / imaging flow - cytometry data
======================

We introduce here a simple and reproducible workflow for classifying phenotypes from images produced by an imaging flow cytometer, or from a collection of identified objects from conventional slide-based microscopy. The workflow demonstrates the process for reading the input, such as CIF files produced by imaging flow cytometers or TIFF, PNG files from a microscope, pre-processing, re-training the classifier, and making predictions. As an output, the workflow delivers visualization with unsupervised clusterization (t-SNE, PCA), as well as machine learning metrics for assessing the accuracy of the trained classifier.

In addition to the example workflow and corresponding data, weâ€™ve also provided weights pre-trained on the example data with the LeNet-5-like convolutional neural network implemented in the imaging-flow-cytometry notebook. We also demonstrate the versatility of the workflow to adapt pre-trained weights from published networks such as VGG19; and the possibility of using the output structure to perform downstream deep learning on different platform such as MATLAB.
